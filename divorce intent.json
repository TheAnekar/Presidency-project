Temporary Court Orders: Since divorce takes time, the court can give temporary orders for spousal support, child custody & visitation, and who pays for what until the divorce is final.\n\n3. Mediation (Cheaper Option): A neutral person helps both spouses reach an agreement. Often required before court. Cost of mediation: ₹1.6 to ₹5 lakh. Cost of court trial: ₹25 lakh+ per person.\n\n4. Gathering Evidence: If no agreement is reached, both sides collect documents and proof. Lawyers help with this process.\n\n5. Settlement: Most cases settle before trial. Settling saves money, time, and stress. The agreement is written down and becomes official.\n\n6. Trial: If no agreement, you go to court. A judge decides the remaining issues. You may appeal if the decision seems unfair."
