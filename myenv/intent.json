      "questions": [
        "A motorist caught driving under the influence of liquor beyond permissible limit is liable to be charged with the offence of drunken driving. Legal permissible limit is 30mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Traffic police use state of art Alco meters (breath analyzers) which is accepted worldwide to measure the level of alcohol in blood. This is scientifically and legally accepted method all over the world. Our instruments are calibrated once in three months with a probable error of +/- 5%. Therefore, we do not panelize anyone below 40mg per 100ml of blood even though legal limit is only 30. Anyone driving with alcohol level below a reading of 40 is not liable for prosecution.\nHowever, not everyone is subjected to breath test. A preliminary or passive test is carried by holding the instrument (breath analyzer) close to the mouth and asking name of the person or to blow which indicates consumption of alcohol (passive test). If the result is negative, no further check is required. If the result is positive, breath sample is taken using the disposable straw and the print out taken using connected printer. Subsequently, the PDA generated police notice is given to the motorists. No one can be prosecuted without a computerized print out indicating reading and a PDA print out mentioning the reading.\nHowever, there is no spot fine for drunken driving. No police officer is allowed to collect spot fines for this offence. The offender will be given a notice, and directed to appear before the jurisdictional court and he has to pay a fine there. The punishment for drunk driving is six month’s imprisonment or payment of a fine up to Rs.10,000/- or both. If the offender is caught committing the offence a second time, he will have to face imprisonment of two years or a fine up to Rs.15,000 or both.\nAfter being issued a notice, the motorist will not be allowed to drive. He will have to leave his vehicle behind and take a cab home or call a friend or relative to drive him home. In case he wants to take the vehicle using the another person who is not drunk but is free to do so after leaving his original driving license and RC book under acknowledgement with the police officer. Very often, motorists try to avoid legal proceedings by bribing the police officers concerned. Follow the proper procedures and do not resort to corruption. Moreover, if a person drives under the influence of alcohol and causes a fatal accident, he will be booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder – which is a non-bailable offence."

        "WHY DO TRAFFIC POLICE SWITCH OFF THE LIGHTS DURING PEAK HOURS?"
      ],
      "answer": "Though it is not a good practice but is inevitable sometimes due to inadequate capacity of junctions. There are situations when the road is not able to take the entire volume of traffic and tail of traffic ahead does not get cleared even till the next green phase. Now if the lights are not switched off, vehicles will block the junction and make it impossible for even cross traffic to move thus creating a grid-lock. It is loose-loose situation for all. At this juncture policemen take over the signal manually and regulate it according to clearance and relative volume. However, this practice is largely reduced and will disappear soon due to increased capacity of roads and junctions and installing adaptive signals. Switching off also becomes inevitable during acts of nature like water logging, cracks in road and man-made situations like strikes, rasta-roko and VIP movement, major accidents, off roading of vehicle, when one or more roads become unavailable for traffic. In all such situations manual operations are resorted to. This practice is however not encouraged."
